# VOC_SA80

With special thanks to Tarabella Middleton, UCL's Department of Chemistry, University of London Officer Training Corps (ULOTC) and 1st Battalion London Guards for helping me make this happen.

Silly side project I ran with UCL to see how military training using blank rounds exposes someone to volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

Method - will be explained in more detail, but basically strapped a VOC sensor to the operator's kit and then let them fire away. Use of audio, video and post-training interviews to sync sensor data to shots and contextualise data.
London Guards weekend data was irretrivable due to hardware faults, but we used that weekend to refine data collection SOPs. Data provided is from a ULOTC exercise.

Rifle specs for gun nuts:

L85A2, Daniel Defense Picatinny rail, SUSAT.
Ammunition: L130A2, Radway Green.
Webbing: PLCE standard issue.

3 files are included: a .txt file called temperature.txt with the raw data taken from a ULOTC training exercise, a notebook picking apart the data and risk assessment forms created for ULOTC x London Guards weekend exercises so NCOs wouldn't beast us for having (seeingly) an IED on our kit.
